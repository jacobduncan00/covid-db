# Features

### Insert
- Select the type of University personnel you are, based off your selection from the dropdown menu, the fields will change on the form. Fill out the form with the required information. Click the submit button and the information will be stored in our SU COVID-19 Database hosted on the Acadweb server using MySQL.

### Search
- Search the SU COVID-19 Database by typing the name of a University personnel and live results will appear giving you general information about that person aswell as their most recent COVID test date and result. The color of their card corresponds to their COVID-19 result which can be matched with the colors in the legend in the top right of the search page.

### Admin
- Ability to insert, delete, and update entries in the SU COVID-19 Database. A easy to use interface that allows users to quickly change and manipulate the data within the database without have to write any queries or touch MySQL.

### Contact
- Write a message to the developers with either feedback, questions, reviews, or bug reports.

### FAQ 
- A general synopsis of the project and the technology that goes into it as well as information about current COVID-19 news.

### Stats
- Stats about the database including total number of entries in the University_personnel table as well as the amount of people positive / negative and the number of students, faculty, and staff in the database as well. 

### Update
- Incremental search for an ID in the database, if ID found, render the form for the user to fill out with the updated information. The form that is rendered is has placeholders that match the data matching the ID that was inserted therefore it is easier for the user to see what the data was for that user before they are changing it. 

### Delete
- Complex delete that traverses the tables in the database and strategically deletes the primary / foreign key ID from each of the child tables of University_personnel table before deleting it from the University_personnel table.
